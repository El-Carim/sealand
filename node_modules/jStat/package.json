Install [msysgit](https://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) (Full installer for official Git),\n   [GNU make for Windows](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm), and a\n   [binary version of Node.js](http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/). Make sure all three packages are installed to the same\n   location (by default, this is C:\\Program Files\\Git).\n2. Install [Cygwin](http://cygwin.com/) (make sure you install the git, make, and which packages), then either follow\n   the [Node.js build instructions](https://github.com/ry/node/wiki/Building-node.js-on-Cygwin-%28Windows%29) or install\n   the [binary version of Node.js](http://node-js.prcn.co.cc/).\n\nMac OS users should install Xcode (comes on your Mac OS install DVD, or downloadable from\n[Apple's Xcode site](http://developer.apple.com/technologies/xcode.html)) and\n[http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/](Homebrew). Once Homebrew is installed, run `brew install git` to install git,\nand `brew install node` to install Node.js.\n\nLinux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install make, git, and node, or build from source\nif you swing that way.\n\n\nBuilding jStat\n--------------\n\nFirst, clone a copy of the jStat git repo by running `git clone git://github.com/jstat/jstat.git`.\n\nTo download all necessary libraries run `npm install`.\n\nThen, to get a complete, minified version of jStat and all documentation, simply `cd` to the `jstat` directory and\ntype `make`. If you don't have Node installed and/or want to make a basic, uncompressed, unlinted version of jstat,\nuse `make jstat` instead of `make`.\n\nThe built version of jStat will be put in the `dist/` subdirectory.\n\nGenerate just the documentation by running `make doc`. Documentation will be placed in `dist/docs` by default.\n\nTo remove all built files, run `make clean`.\n\n\nRunning Tests\n-------------\n\nExecute all tests by running `make test`.\n\nOr if you wish to run a specific test, `cd` to `test/<subdir>` and run `node <some_test>-test.js`.\n\n\nGet the Code\n------------\n\nBoth the minified and unminified source are located in the `dist/` directory. For those who don't want to build\nit themselves.\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\njStat is now going to follow most of the v8\n[JavaScript](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml)\nguidelines. There will be plenty of source that uses the old style, but we're\ngoing to work away from that.\n\nAlso, we'll be going through and reimplementing a good portion of the code to\nrun faster. Hopefully it won't take too long to get the project on one basic\nstandard.\n\n\nJoin the Community\n------------------\n\nWe always like discussion of how to improve jStat.\nJoin us at our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/jstat-discuss/) and let us know what you'd like to see.\nAlso come ask questions in the #jstat channel on irc.freenode.net.\n\n\nCDN\n---\n\nThe library is hosted on [jsDelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/) using the follwing\nurl:\n```\n//cdn.jsdelivr.net/jstat/<version>/jstat.min.js\n```\n",
