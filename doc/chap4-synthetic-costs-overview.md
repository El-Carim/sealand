# Synthetic Cost Overview

In this *Chapter*, we outline the basis for deriving an estimate of the costs of natural disasters using what we have termed a "synthetic" approach -- the third approach we outlined in *Chapter 1*.

The synthetic approach is so-called because it aims to *synthesise* the different cost components that make up the total costs of a disaster. This is contrast with approaches 1 and 2, that instead estimate costs on the basis of reported and insured costs respectively. In theory, synthetic costs ought to lead to more accurate estimates, as they account for the many specific direct, indirect and intangible costs resulting from a given disaster's impact. This is in contrast particularly to approach 2, which applies generic disaster type multipliers to the insured cost, assuming therefore the insured cost is a highly reliable indicator of what the total costs will be. The synthetic approach instead costs each effect of a disaster -- the number of people evacuated, the number of public and private buildings damaged or destroyed, the loss of ecosystem service, heritage and other intangibles -- separately.

In practice, the synthetic approach is exceedingly difficult to apply both to historical and present-day events. Due to the location of the disaster, the duration of its impacts, the varieties of data estimation, and the perceived significance of data collection, the methods of data collection at different disaster sites varies considerably. In spite of these practical difficulties, the pursuit of more reliable estimates is a worthy goal. Both BTE 2001 and this AUS-DIS update recommend strengthening practices of data collection central to a more fine-grained and accurate estimation of costs. The BTE's own statement of estimates was partial and is now somewhat dated; this section aims for a more complete and up-to-date summary of the steps needed to derive a synthesised cost.

The section begins with a list of data elements that correspond to common disaster impacts. It then describes how these elements can be recorded, and how direct, indirect, and intangible costs derived. Two graphs of total synthetic costs, by year and by decade, are compared with equivalent graphs 3.1 and 3.2 from *Chapter 3*. Finally, some of the limitations and complications that arise from applying a synthesised approach are discussed.
